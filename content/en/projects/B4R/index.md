### Receivers on the world Largest Submillimeter Telescope

#### B4R project
B4R is a receiver system which consists of 2mm receiver and a dedicated digital spectrometer composed of 4 (-> 6) XFFTS boards, integrated on the Large Millimeter Telescope (LMT, 50m) at Mexico.
I'm working on:
* Development of data reduction pipeline ([b4rpipe](https://github.com/LMT-heterodyne-dev/b4rpipe))
* On-site commissioning (Nov. 2019, 2021?)
* OTF observations toward Galactic objects

#### LST project
The 50m Large Submillimeter Telescope (LST) is a planned single-dish telescope, which is optimized for wide-area imaging and spectroscopic surveys in the 70-420 GHz frequency range.
I'm working on:
* Scientific consideration of [CII]/[OIII] intensity mapping
